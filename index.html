        <p>I have always enjoyed a challenge, and I always try to find a better way to do something;
        In programming there is always more to learn, and almost always a better method. I beleive that if a skill is hard to master,
        then it is worth mastering. In addition to learning code and making a program run well, I enjoy making a good design with
        appealing aesthetics. I'm restless when it comes to making a website (or wood project) look good.</p>
