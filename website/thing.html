        <p>This deck controls the board with traditional control, as well as tempo return-to-hand elements. The main reason
        I like this deck is it has fast 1 mana responses and access to rending volley, which is great against bant company, and humans.
        Fevered visions is especialy good against control decks because it forces them to empty out their hand, and the fact that
        it's an enchantment makes it hard to get rid of, not to mention you have your own counterspells to protect your things.
        If you want to pinch some pennies, use the uncommon vanilla dual lands, and maybe a couple evolving wilds, but try not
        to have to many tapped lands for the purpose of taking advatage of the deck's fast response.</p>

        <h2>sideborading</h2>
        <p>the good thing about this deck is the win conditions have synergies, and the cards can be very versitle.
        thing in the ice works as a win condition, a board wipe, and it works well with fevered visions. Fevered visions
        works as both a win condition and as card draw (not exactly card advatage though). cards with awaken work well 
        with man lands, and can get in a lot of extra damage, so even though this is mainly a control deck, it can finish 
        the game fairly quick. The exceptionally low mana curve means that the deck doesn't have to have infinite lands 
        to function well.</p>
        
        <h3>control decks</h3>
        <p>sideboarding against a control deck is pretty straight forward, remove radiant flames, clutch of currents, 
        and basically any instants/sorceries that target creatures. side in a bunch of counterspells, ojutai's command,
        all three burn from within. Rise from the tides could also be a good option, as most other control decks will
        most likely side out languish. The sideboarding is pretty straight forward, but you might be asking, why three 
        copies of invasive surgery? even though invasive surgery is very niche, it's pretty relevant in the current 
        standard meta, most control decks will be playing duress, transgress the mind, dark petition, ruinous path, ect.
        and if you are playing against a seasons past deck, you have even more target to counter.</p>
        
        <h3>bant company decks</h3>
        <p>Bant company is the main reason dispel is in the main deck, so siding in the third is good, also rending volley 
        is a good answer to most of their creatures. burn from within and dec in stone aren't great in this match up, also
        void shatter, and one negate could be worth siding out</p>
        
        <h3>humans</h3>
        <p>there are a couple variantions of humans, bant humans is similar to bant company, but mono white and white splash 
        blue are a bit different. In mono white, cards like negate, void shatter, and scatter to the winds aren't very useful.
        rending volley, and firey impulse are good 1 mana answers. it's, the same for splash blue, but negate and scatter are
        good for getting rid of gideon, and stoping an annoying reflector mage.</p>
